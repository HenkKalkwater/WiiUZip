# WiiUZip (Linux fork)
Archive manager for Wii U filetypes, but it also works on Linux (requires Mono to be installed).

# Main differences
* This fork uses GTK# for the GUI, for a better look within most Linux distrobutions

# Features
* Extract most .szs and .sarc files
* Shows archive size (function not present in the project this was forked from)
* Kind of ready to be localized.

# Missing features (compared to the project this was forked from)
* Adding, removing and replacing files from an archive.
* No filetype associations
